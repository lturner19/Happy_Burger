## FEATURES

A burger app that allows users to input a burger they would like to devour. Once the user clicks the submit button, the burger is then put into "Burgers Not Devoured" column with a "Devour It" button. When user clicks the button, the burger is then moved to the devoured column.  All of the users' choices are stored in a mySQL database.


<br>

## INSTALLATION

1. To use the application, install (npm install) the following dependencies:

    * express: node framework

    * express-handlebars: allows server-side manipulation of HTML ("templating engine")

    * mysql: allows access to mySQL database

2. Users will need to install mySQL in order to create a database using the burgers_db schema and seed files.

3. Users should enter their own personal mySQL password in the connection.js file.
